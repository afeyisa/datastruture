/*
it goes further when all the vertices adjecent to the starting vertex are visited
use a queue instead of stack 

steps
1. Pick a starting node
2. if possible visit an adjecent unvisited vertex , mark it ,
and insert it into the queue
3. if there are no unvisited adjacent nodes, then remove a vertex from the queue
4a. if queue is not empty go to step 2
4b. if the queue is empty you are done
